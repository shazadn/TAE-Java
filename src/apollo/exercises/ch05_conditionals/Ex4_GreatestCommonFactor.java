	}
	
	// Create a method called greatestCommonFactor
	// It should return the greatest common factor
	// between two numbers.  
	//
	// Examples of greatestCommonFactor:
	//   greatestCommonFactor(6, 4)   // returns 2
	//   greatestCommonFactor(7, 9)   // returns 1
	//   greatestCommonFactor(20, 30) // returns 10
	//
	// Hint: start a counter from 1 and try to divide both
	// numbers by the counter. If the remainder of both divisions
	// is 0, then the counter is a common factor. Continue incrementing
	// the counter to find the greatest common factor. Use a while loop
	// to increment the counter.
