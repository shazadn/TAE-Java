		// Step 1: Declarations
		//   Declare a string for your name (name)
		//   Declare an integer for the temperature (temp)
		//   Declare a double for the percent chance of rain (chanceOfRain)
		
		// Step 2: Assignments
		//   Set name to your name
		//   Set the temperature to 65
		//   Set the percent chance of rain to 0.45 (45% chance of rain)
		
		// Step 3: Output
		//   Using a single println statement, output the following:
		//   Hello, Mike, today's high is 65 degrees, with a 45% chance of rain.
		
		// Tip: For the percent chance of rain, use the multiplication operator
		//      in the output line to change the decimal to a percentage.
		
		// Hint: You can "cast" a decimal to a integer to truncate the extra decimal places
		//      (int) (someDecimalVal * 100)
